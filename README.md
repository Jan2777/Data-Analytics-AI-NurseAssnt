# 🩺 Real-Time AI Nurse Assistant  
### Summarizing and Translating Post-Consultation Clinical Instructions in Multilingual Outpatient Settings

---

## 🧠 Overview
This project proposes a **Real-Time AI Nurse Assistant** that listens to outpatient consultations, summarizes medical instructions, and translates them into the patient’s preferred language.  
It aims to enhance **communication, compliance, and accessibility** in multilingual clinical environments — particularly during public health crises such as **COVID-19**.

The system leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for summarization, **Whisper ASR** for transcription, and **mBART/NLLB** for multilingual translation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable **real-time transcription** of doctor–patient conversations.  
- Generate **concise, patient-friendly summaries** of clinical advice.  
- Provide **multilingual translation** for diverse outpatient populations.  
- Ensure **privacy-preserving** data handling via federated and edge AI deployment.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system operates through a modular pipeline:

1. **Audio Input (Frontend)**  
   - Captures live or recorded doctor–patient conversations.  
   - Built using **HTML + JS frontend** and **Flask backend**.

2. **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**  
   - Whisper model converts speech to text with > 94 % accuracy.

3. **Summarization Module**  
   - Uses **FLAN-T5** and **LLaMA-2** fine-tuned on clinical data to extract key actionable instructions.

4. **Translation Module**  
   - **mBART-50** and **NLLB-200** models handle multilingual translation with low latency.

5. **Output Delivery**  
   - Displays simplified instructions in both **text and audio** format.
